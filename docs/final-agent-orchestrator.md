# Multi-Agent Orchestration Architecture

## Overview

This document describes a production-grade, scalable architecture for multi-agent orchestration designed to support multi-tenant SaaS environments with strong tenant isolation, dynamic workflow management, and modular agent microservices.

### Key Components

- **Orchestrator Layer**: Includes two specialized agents:
  - **Intent Agent**: Handles user queries and intent interpretation.
  - **Planner Agent**: Responsible for workflow planning and decision-making on delegating tasks to downstream agents.
  
- **Task Agents (n handlers)**: A collection of specialized agents that execute individual tasks as delegated by the Planner Agent.

### Agent-to-Agent Communication Protocol

There are two main layers of agent-to-agent (A2A) communication within this architecture:

1. Between **Intent Agent** and **Planner Agent**  
2. Between **Planner Agent** and the multiple **Task Agents** (which may operate in parallel or sequentially, as decided by the Planner)

### Multi-Tenant Considerations

- Tenant context and security policies are injected per request, ensuring strict tenant-level isolation across all agents and data sources.
- Centralized orchestration ensures robust security, observability, and control.
- This model supports dynamic workflows, parallel and sequential task execution, and multi-source data integration.

## Why This Design?

- **Centralized Orchestration** maintains control, manages complex dependency flows, error handling, and retries.
- **Planner Agent as Decision Maker** allows dynamic runtime workflow planning, including parallel and sequential execution.
- **Clear A2A Communication Layers** remove tight coupling, improve maintainability, and simplify scalability.
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation** through tenant context injection and policy enforcement at every orchestration and agent layer.
- Aligns with current production trends in leading AI agent orchestration platforms from AWS, Microsoft, Anthropic, and others.

## Production Alignment

This architecture matches industry best practices as documented in recent 2025 references:

- Layered orchestration with intent and planner agents coordinating task agents[1][2][3].
- Strong multi-tenant capabilities ensuring security and compliance through tenant context propagation and isolation[4][5].
- Use of agent-to-agent (A2A) communication protocols supported by emerging standards to enable scalable, fault-tolerant workflows[6].
